# ScrambleDiscordBot
A simple but effective bot for recieving new posts on the Scramble.nl Messageboard / Forum

## **USAGE**

I have made the usage of this bot as easy as possible so anyone can do it.
First of all, make sure you have node.js **already installed** on your device.
Next up run *npm install discord.js axios cheerio dotenv fs* <- this will install everything you need for this bot to run.
Next up, fill in the .env, this should be straightforward.
use node bot.js to start ur bot
Now, do /addtopic (link)
To make sure it worked, do /listtopics
You should be able to add as much topics at once, but idk if it will break alot ðŸ˜‚
